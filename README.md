# etch-a-sketch

For this project we are tasked with creating somehting between
an Etch-a-Sketch and a sketchpad with the intention to demonstrate 
strong DOM manipulation skills along with JS methods and CSS.

Project finish reflection:
As intended, I feel much more comfortable manipulating the DOM.
Difficult to wrap my head around at first, 
but the struggle was a valuable learning experience.
